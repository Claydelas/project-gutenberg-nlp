Do YOU know me?
Perhaps you’d like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?
Has that fellow’--to the man with the wooden leg--‘been here again?
You’ll be glad to spend another shilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say?
And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh?
You haven’t got a sister, have you?
Hey?
What money have you got, Copperfield?
Not yet?
What’s the report of this boy?
What’s this?
Do you want to spend anything now?
Traddles?
